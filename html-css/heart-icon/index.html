The next thing to do is to set the viewBox attribute of the svg element. This will control how much of the image is visible. The first two numbers set the center of the image.
The following two numbers set the size of the image can we see; width followed by height.
Since here the entirety of the icon should be visible, you should set the viewBox attribute to 0 0 24 24.
The path element needs its shape defined. That is where the d attribute comes in. It is used to create a series of command letters and numbers that draw a shape.
These letters represent commands like move to, draw line, and close, while the numbers represent coordinates.
Set the heart shape's d attribute to M12 21s-6-4.35-9.33-8.22C-.5 7.39 3.24 1 8.4 4.28 10.08 5.32 12 7.5 12 7.5s1.92-2.18 3.6-3.22C20.76 1 24.5 7.39 21.33 12.78 18 16.65 12 21 12 21z.
