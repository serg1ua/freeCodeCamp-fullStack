        In 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed across the Mojave Desert. Duke, under the influence
        of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, and inventories their drug stash. They
        pick up a young hitchhiker and explain their mission: Duke has been assigned by a magazine
        to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. They bought excessive drugs for the
        trip, and rented a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The hitchhiker flees on foot at their
        behavior.
